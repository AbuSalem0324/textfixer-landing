Now, let's update the script.js to handle the free tier registration:


script.js (Updated)
Code ∙ Version 2 
Finally, let's create a success page for free tier users:

Edit

free-success.html
Code ∙ Version 2 
Now I've provided all the frontend files you'll need for the complete Stripe integration with the freemium model. Here's a summary of the files I've created or updated:

Frontend Files
index.html (Updated):
Added freemium pricing comparison
Added free tier option with limits clearly displayed
Updated button text and styling
script.js (Updated):
Added support for both pro and free registration flows
Connected free tier signup to the backend endpoint
Dynamic text changes based on selected plan
styles.css (Updated):
Added new styling for pricing comparison section
Added featured plan highlight
Improved responsive design for pricing cards
success.html (Updated):
Changed to focus on email delivery of access code
Simplified the content to direct users to their email
free-success.html (New):
Created a separate success page for free tier users
Added clear information about free tier limits
Included upgrade prompts to encourage conversion
Backend Files
textfixer/routes/stripe.py:
Added new endpoint for free tier registration
Connected to email service for access code delivery
textfixer/services/email.py:
Created email delivery service
Designed professional HTML email template
Environment Settings:
Added SMTP configuration options
How to Connect Everything
Configure your backend:
Update your Stripe API keys
Set up SMTP email settings
Deploy the updated backend
Update your frontend:
Replace the placeholder API_URL in script.js with your actual backend URL
Update the shortcut download URL with your actual iOS shortcut link
Deploy the static files to your hosting provider
Test both flows:
Test the free tier registration
Test the pro tier subscription with Stripe
Verify email delivery in both cases
The implementation now supports both the freemium model and the data collection strategy we discussed. You should be all set to launch with colleagues and family for testing!




so the textfixer/routes/stripe.py
the version 6 well above + add the free endpoint to it?

Edit
Yes, exactly. You should take the existing textfixer/routes/stripe.py file and add the free tier endpoint to it. I created separate artifacts for clarity, but in practice you'll need to merge them.

Here's how to add the free tier endpoint to your existing stripe.py file:

Open your current textfixer/routes/stripe.py file
Add the following code at the end of the file (after the other route definitions):
python
@stripe_bp.route("/register-free", methods=["POST"])
@handle_errors
def register_free_tier():
    """
    Endpoint to register a new free tier user.
    
    Expects a JSON payload with an 'email' field.
    Creates a user account and sends the access code via email.
    """
    data = request.get_json()
    
    if not data or not data.get("email"):
        return jsonify({"error": "Email required"}), 400
        
    email = data.get("email")
    
    try:
        # Create a new user with default free tier limits
        from ..services.user import create_user
        result = create_user(email)
        
        if not result:
            return jsonify({"error": "Failed to create user"}), 500
            
        # Send access code via email
        from ..services.email import send_access_code_email
        email_sent = send_access_code_email(email, result["api_key"])
        
        return jsonify({
            "success": True,
            "message": "Free account created successfully. Check your email for your access code.",
            "email_sent": email_sent
        })
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Free tier registration error: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({"error": f"Registration failed: {str(e)}"}), 500
This endpoint handles the free tier registration process by:

Creating a user in the database
Sending the access code via email
Returning a success message to the frontend
The frontend will then redirect the user to the free-success.html page that explains what to expect next.
